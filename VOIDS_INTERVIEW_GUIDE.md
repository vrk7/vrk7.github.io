## 💡 Key Talking Points (Memorize)

### Your Unique Value Proposition
"Full-stack engineer who specializes in data-heavy systems with clean UX. Proven track record of shipping production systems (AWS, Docker, PostgreSQL), optimizing performance (50% latency reduction), and building interfaces for complex data—exactly VOIDS' challenge."

### Your 3 Strongest Projects
1. **Contract Clause Analyzer** → Data-heavy UI for complex backend (live demo!)
2. **Voice Agent** → Real-time performance optimization (<400ms barge-in)
3. **Kontext.dev** → Production B2B SaaS with 50% latency reduction

### Your 5 Superpowers for VOIDS
1. **End-to-End Ownership** - Built complete products from scratch
2. **Performance Optimization** - Proven track record (50% reduction, <400ms)
3. **Production Experience** - AWS, Docker, PostgreSQL, comprehensive testing
4. **Data-Heavy UX** - Contract analysis, metrics dashboards, streaming
5. **AI Background** - Unique edge for AI-based forecasting platform

---

## 🎤 Your Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"I'm a full-stack AI engineer who specializes in building production systems that handle complex data with clean, intuitive UX. I've shipped systems to AWS, optimized latency by 50%, and built data-heavy interfaces—from contract analysis to real-time voice systems. I own features end-to-end: from understanding user needs, to backend architecture, to frontend deployment. VOIDS' challenge of presenting complex forecasting data through digestible UI is exactly what I love solving."

---

## ❓ Your Top 6 Questions for Tobi

1. "You're migrating from NestJS to Next.js. What drove that decision?"

2. "How do you handle ETL from raw e-commerce data (Shopify/WooCommerce) to forecasts?"

3. "Pre-compute forecasts in batch jobs, or on-demand when users load dashboard?"

4. "Most complex feature request where UI/UX was challenging due to data complexity?"

5. "With 300% growth, what scaling challenges in next 6-12 months?"

6. "Beyond first 3 months, what makes this hire 'a home run'?"

---

## 🛡️ Handling Objections

### "Not enough TypeScript production experience"
✅ "Fair—recent work is Python-heavy. But I've used TypeScript (React 18 + Vite), and my Pydantic experience translates directly to TypeScript's type system. Type safety patterns are language-agnostic. I've consistently ramped up quickly across stacks (SAP UI, React, Python)."

### "No eCommerce or B2B SaaS experience"
✅ "True—no eCommerce specifically. But Capgemini was 3 years building enterprise finance systems (daily usage, high-volume). Core challenge is the same: reliable systems with complex logic → clean UI. My Contract Analyzer is essentially B2B SaaS: professional tool with usage tracking, rate limiting, AWS production deployment."

### "Strong AI background—is this too ML-focused?"
✅ "Actually a differentiator. VOIDS is AI-based forecasting—you're building interfaces for AI systems. I understand ML models, their limits, how to present probabilistic predictions user-friendly. Plus, I've built end-to-end products (not just models). Full-stack engineer who understands AI—ideal for VOIDS."

---

## 📊 Key Stats to Mention

**Quantifiable Achievements:**
- **Capgemini:** 3 years full-stack (2019-2022), daily usage by finance teams
- **Kontext:** 50% latency reduction
- **Voice Agent:** <400ms barge-in, <900ms TTFB (p95), 20 concurrent call testing
- **Contract Analyzer:** 7 clause types, PostgreSQL + ChromaDB, AWS EC2 production
- **Sony:** Temporally-aware semantic retrieval, SLURM distributed systems
- **MGH:** 81-89% IoU segmentation, Visual Question Localization
